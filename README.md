This repository is a python implementation of both the steady-state and unsteady models presented in Carpenter et al., (2016) as used in Cassin et al., (2024).

Glider_Data:

The glider2composite notebook utilizes glider data found within the wind lease area to create composite profiles used to initialize models.

Model 1:

The model1 notebook implements the steady-state model using the composite profiles generated from glider data to calculate mixing timescales.

Model 2:

The model2 notebook implements the idealized unsteady model using the composite profiles generated from glider data to calculate mixing timescales.
